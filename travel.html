				<p id="normal-paragraph">Eh voilà, here I am in the -land of vikings- ~ Denmark. Is it not W.O.N.D.E.R.F.U.L????? In the purpose that you can understand -what is going on?- or -how did I ended up in Denmark?- I will start from the beginning>>>>>>>
Once upon a time, I saw an announcement in one of the random e-mails I get from my university career program. I read the word -Denmark.- How could I say NO to this calling? Impossible!!!! Just the idea of actually visiting this country was divine. The excitement started since the moment I got accepted in the Danish Summer Course and it keeps growing every second.
A couple of days ago, when I started to pack for the journey, I could feel my heart beating faster. Btw in my luggage are found the most important stuff a girl should have for a 2 weeks get-away-from-home, such as: beauty + cosmetic products, 5 tops + 3 bottoms + 2 dresses, 2 bags, sandals, vans, sunglasses, cap, camera and a looooot more.
As long as I live in Albania, the trip to Denmark is not just a few hours long. Unfortunately, I had to stop in other airports and wait and wait for the next flight. The good news is that I always try to not get bored and see the interesting side in things. In this case, I stopped at the -Fiumicino- Airport in Rome and -Charles De Gaulle- Airport in Paris. 
To avoid thoughts like -goodness I’m so tired- or -so boring waiting here alone,- I started analyzing the structure of the building, people in uniforms, people arriving from a flight or the others getting ready to start the flight. So many faces and so many different expressions.
Then, while spending the night alone on Paris, I made the compare and contrast between two airports. Seems legit, right? well, maybe I will write another time about this psychological theory :D 
At last, I arrived in Copenhagen at 2 pm, where I met a friend. Both we took the train to the city where the course is. Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to visit Copenhagen, but I will leave this issue to time to solve it. Meanwhile in train, I enjoyed the beautiful view ~ wide fields, horses, small houses and narrow-slow rivers.
The greatest moment was when I arrived at campus. I met with the people who will be helping us during this period of time and other students.  Wonderful people.
Now, after spending a few days in here I can certainly say it was worth applying and making such a long trip.</p>
