			<h3>Broken Tower- the movie :D</h3>
			<p id="normal-paragraph">As I was in a bored mood this late afternoon, I decided to break that unpleasant frame of mind by doing something meaningful. The first idea that crossed my mind was watching a movie which had an particular deep meaning. Well, the truth is that I am certainly not a fan of biographic books or movies, but I know I can find a significant thought in each of them.

			While a very short searching process, my eye caught an experimental film by James Franco. As long as I like Francos acting, all I thought was why not.

			The film is James Francos impression of what Hart Crane was like. To be honest I did not know Crane before, but right after watching this incredible movie I became very interested in reading his poetry work.

			Franco has created an unbelievable deep and thoughtful angle of Crane s life. The beautiful combination of the black and white format, the great acting by James Franco, the poetry and the silence pieces make the movie extremely emotional. All the emotions are skilled enough to get out the screen and goes directly to my body. So affecting and moving.

			Inspirational speeches and the readings as a background music made me experience his feelings during 12 voyages he went through. His pain and doubt.

			I picked a few quotes from the movie that I felt the most.

			Language has built towers and bridges, but itself is inevitably as fluid as always.
			The truth is not beautiful. In fact is quite indecent. But the importance is how to get it into poetry. All of it: jazz, war words, type-writers, buildings, freeways, everything.
			The goose, tobacco and cologne: three wing and gold shot prophecies of heaven.
			And you can fall down stairs with me.We are breathless

			A lot may say -well done-, but me, I would have preferred -perfectly done.- Totally worth watching.</p>
