				<p id="normal-paragraph">December 6-8 2013 were quite interesting days for me. Me and two of my university friends participated in a 
				business competition in Vilnius. During November of that year we spent time in analysing a case study and creating a video. After these 
				two steps we passed in the final round, which took place in ISM University, in Vilnius. There were a few more competing teams. Personally, 
				I mostly enjoyed Friday 6th, when we participated in different get-to-know activities around the city. We all had such a fun time. Amazing! 
				During Saturday, we listened to 2hour conference/speech from an African-Belg business scholar, which would be helpful for our final case analysis.
				Saturday evening continued with more fun activities and dinner. We got the opportunity to sleep a couple of hours in a hostel nearby and then 
				went back to ISM around 11pm to have an all-nighter. It certainly was a really tiring night. We had to go through each step: reading, brainstorming, 
				analysing, writing, designing, and preparing for presentation. Morning came very soon :) The organizer has planned some time for breakfast and then
				immediately started the presentations. While listening to other teams presenting, I was very nervous of how my team and I would do. We were the 4th in turn. 
				Everything went pretty well: both the speech/explanation part and the answering to the jury's questions part. By 12pm everyone was finished presenting 
				and the Closing Assembly started. After the thanking process, the organizer invited one person from the jury to introduce the awards. Our team won the Third Place. 
				I was actually quite happy about it, even though we did a good job. At the end, what it really matters are the people we had a chance to meet, the
				great insight about business taught from respectful people in this field, the awesome experience of feeling as business analyst. All of these 
				elements are so precious to me and closer to my heart than the place written in a paper.
