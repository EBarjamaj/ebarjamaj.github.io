				<h3>Hottest Spring/ Summer Trends</h3>
			</div>
			<p id="normal-paragraph">It is a new year, a new season and as a result we all need to bring some new arrivals into our wardrobe. To get an idea about the new trends for spring/summer 2015, I took a look at my favorites designers runways.

			Some of them totally surprised me (and that is not something that happen usually to me ^^), meanwhile, I can say I have seen the others in use and already popular.

			I will try to round up the best looks from the runaways (in my opinion) including all their cute and weird features ;)

			Let s get it started with:</p>
				
				<div align="center">
					<p style="foto1"><img src="stripes.jpg" alt="Stripes" align="middle" height="300px" width="350px"></p>
				</div>
				<div id="normal-lists">		
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Statement Stripes</strong>- Well this trend is seen everywhere and I guess will continue successfully for some time. Stripes have appeared bold in black, in white or a mix of colors and messy designs. The important thing is that a huge number of people have liked this very cute design. Personally, I adore it and will add some stripe-clothing on my wardrobe.</li>
						<li><strong>Minimalism</strong>- I do not know why, but I found the simple soft lines and cool colors very attractive and soooo much fancy. These are the features of minimalism used mostly by Nicloe Farhi and Calvin Klein. I love the new looks from the designers who have used minimalism because they are closer to my style <3.</li>
						<li><strong>Graphics</strong>- I really admire the bold shapes and even bolder color combinations. I bet you have seen around girls and boys widely wearing graphic prints, slogan shirts and color clashing. This designs bring light in your look and make it look more fun and playful in the same time!!!</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div align="center">
					<p style="foto1"><img src="minimalism-graphics.jpg" alt="M&G" align="middle" height="200px" width="400px"></p>
				</div>
				<div id="normal-lists">	
					</ul>
						<li><strong>Monochrome</strong>- This season you will never go wrong wearing black and white. I find it seriously fancy and very fashionable. At least one piece of monochrome clothing is a must have this spring/summer. Personally, I will run and make one of those part of my wardrobe.</li>
						<li><strong>Sheen Team</strong>- A super shinning metallic trend or shimmering texture that grabs attention in a second. If this is your purpose then you can play this card. Even though shinning stuff are not at all my style, I would consider I guess only one dress at this design for myself :p</li>
						<li><strong>Sixties</strong>- Quite a lot of fashion designers are bringing back some classic shapes from 60s trends. I would use the phrase -they are bringing sexy back. I totally love this style. It seems like I find myself here- at every piece of clothing. AWESOME <3</li>
					</ul>

				</div>	
						<p id="normal-paragraph">I tried really hard to fit every new trend for this season and I hope I accomplished my mission. If you have noticed some others please comment below to add them. Even though I for sure will not combine all of these trends with my style, I am 100% in love with some of them and I know that the others are very professionally fulfilled. Catch what better fits you and make the others turn their heads with the hottest trends this season.
